# CRATR-Assignment

PFA the given assigment
I did not undersatnd the logic of "On every day, the time passes linearly from midnight to midnight.  
                                   For example, on 26th of December 2018, at 15:40, the time left until the end of the year should be (25 / 72 + 3 + 0.75 + 0.5) days"
                                   The calculation of 25/72 was not quite clear to me. Hence I have simple ignored current day(eg: 26th dec 2018)
                                   Also the parameterPrinterDemo is the porject for parameter server.
